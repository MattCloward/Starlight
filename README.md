# Starlight

This is a data pack I (Icedice9) made with Beck Phillips for the Minecraft club. We used it as the doomsday content for the finale of our world "Sinai." It look about 6 months of planning and coding to complete.

It was a lot of fun that night, but a bit laggy and it needs some improvements. One place to start would be increasing the number of ticks between checking player hands for the "remnant" item.

## Main Features:
* Skulk spreads when xp has been on the ground for too long
* Instead of spawning sculk sensors, catalysts, and shriekers, sentient sculk, spider lights, and weaker wardens are spawned instead
* If the player stands on sculk for too long (even jumping), the sculk becomes sentient and attacks
* A boss with 3 phases: attached to ceiling laser-shooting phase, jumping around phase, and smaller sections phase
* An item named "remnant" will have mysterious particles around it

## Helpful Commands
Here are a few of the commands that I found helpful while running the data pack:
